<lyrics>
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day I die
Imma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day I die
Imma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink Polos hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team I couldn't work the Lox locks
Now let's go
Take them back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apartment
Let's take them back to the club
Least about a hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob a hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dog in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dog you where I am
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in a accident cause this must be heaven
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day I die
Imma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day I die
Imma touch the sky
Now let's take them high la la la la la la la
Top of the world baby Top of the world
Now let's take them high la la la la la la la
Top of the world baby Top of the world
Top of the world baby Top of the world
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I get it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man, these niggas that much better than me
Baby I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Now I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day you die
You going touch the sky
You going touch the sky baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
Before the day you die
You going to touch the sky
Yes yes yes guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third
Hear like ear until I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm tryna stop Lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
En garde touché Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day you die
You going touch the sky
You going touch the sky baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
Before the day you die
You going touch the sky
We back at home baby
Sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
Sky sky-high
I'm I'm sky-high
Keep it rolling
Feels good to be home baby
Feels good to be home

<lyrics>She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me
She gives me money
Now I ain't saying she a gold digger when I'm in need
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
She gives me money
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger when I'm in need
But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
Get down girl go head get down I gotta leave
Get down girl go head get down I gotta leave
Get down girl go head get down I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head
Cutie the bomb
Met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton
Under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock
I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one
Have you seen her
My psychic told me she have an ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
OK get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend says she use to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her
18 years 18 years
She got one of your kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby mamma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured got GEICO for your money, money, money
If you ain't no punk holla we want prenup
WE WANT PRENUP Yeah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo ass she gon' leave with half
18 years 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his
Now I ain't saying you're a gold digger you got needs
You don't want your dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know this dude's balling but yeah that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head
lemme hear that back

<lyrics>Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homie
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
My homie Mali used to stay one 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little something 16 he was stunting
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
With the girls a lot of flirting involved
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homies
He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
Ya never know homie about these hoes homie
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homie
What It do
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunk open, screen's on, neon's lit with fifth relax
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawling, you see them screens falling
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm balling
I'm leaning on a switch sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on those fours I'm jamming off this screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby what it do?
Drive slow homie
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homie
If you riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homie
Live today cause tomorrow man you never know
Ya never know homie might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live
And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homie drive slow
Chopped and Screwed
Yeah
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
Ya never know homie might meet some hoes homie
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what maybe you're right, aight
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock that's primetime
Heaven'll watch God calling from the hot lines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

Class back in session so I up't it a grade
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all brides maids catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy

Man the game all messed up
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit
No no I can't study war
Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I can't study war

And you say Chi city Chi city Chi city
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homie
I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang-affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't never hit the airport
To follow your dream
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seems
Like she talking about me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking about what niggas tryna do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talking about Chi Town
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and then
Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again
Coming home again
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again

<lyrics>
Ain't no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge so why you playing I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them falling for the love of balling
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied until all my niggas get it get it?
Ain't no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge so why you playing I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shooting a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game this is my Olympics
We make them say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga I must have missed it
Ain't no question if I want it I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down down down
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get into school
He said Take them glasses off and get in the pool
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell them hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
I done copped Timb's lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits fresh fruits Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up smoking one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one Ls
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head bolder head would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
That meant code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch back of the old shed
If you can't live you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining to every young man this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye
Not for nothing I've foreseen it I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down down down

MJ gone our nigga dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home I'm almost there
I'm on my way heading up the stairs
To my surprise a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
All of the lights
Cop lights flashlights spot lights
Strobe lights street lights

Courts sucked me dry
I spent that bread
